\big{Overview} \n
This repository contains the code and reports for projects completed as part of the "Mathematical Physics Practicum" course. Each project involves implementing numerical algorithms to solve various physics problems and analyzing the results. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including: \n

  1.) Airy Functions: Calculation of Ai(x) and Bi(x) using Maclaurin and asymptotic series. \n
  2.) Random Walks: Simulation and analysis of random walks. \n
  3.) Eigenvalue Problems: Solving eigenvalue problems with matrix decomposition algorithms. \n
  4.) Discrete Fourier Transform: Implementation of the DFT.  \n
  5.) Fast Fourier Transform: Efficient calculation using the FFT algorithm. \n
  6.) Linear Differential Equations: Solving first-order linear differential equations. \n
  7.) Second Order Newton Differential Equations: Analysis and solution methods.  \n
  8.) Boundary Value Problems: Numerical methods for solving boundary value problems.  \n
  9.) Spectral Methods: Utilizing spectral methods for differential equations.  \n
  10.) Differential Methods: Various differential methods for solving physics problems.  \n
  11.) Galerkin Methods: Applying Galerkin methods to partial differential equations.  \n
  12.) Machine Learning for Higgs Boson Classification: Final project involving the use of machine learning techniques for classifying Higgs boson data.  \n

The written reports are in Slovenian as they were part of my classes at the university, I will translate as many as possible.
