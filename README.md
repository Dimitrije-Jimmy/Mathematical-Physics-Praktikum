# Mathematical Physics Practicum Projects

## Overview

This repository contains the code and reports for projects completed as part of the "Mathematical Physics Practicum" course. Each project involves implementing numerical algorithms to solve various physics problems and analyzing the results. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

1. **Airy Functions**: Calculation of Ai(x) and Bi(x) using Maclaurin and asymptotic series.

2. **Random Walks**: Simulation and analysis of random walks.

3. **Eigenvalue Problems**: Solving eigenvalue problems with matrix decomposition algorithms.

4. **Discrete Fourier Transform**: Implementation of the DFT.

5. **Fast Fourier Transform**: Efficient calculation using the FFT algorithm.

6. **Linear Differential Equations**: Solving first-order linear differential equations.

7. **Second Order Newton Differential Equations**: Analysis and solution methods.

8. **Boundary Value Problems**: Numerical methods for solving boundary value problems.

9. **Spectral Methods**: Utilizing spectral methods for differential equations.

10. **Differential Methods**: Various differential methods for solving physics problems.

11. **Galerkin Methods**: Applying Galerkin methods to partial differential equations.

12. **Machine Learning for Higgs Boson Classification**: Final project involving the use of machine learning techniques for classifying Higgs boson data.

The reports (filenames: Dimitrije_Pešić_##.pdf) are written in Slovenian as part of my university class, I will translate as many of them as I can. Code named main##.py is my own and some other files are my own, other files are open source. 
The naming convention and best practices are ignored in many examples as the looming deadlines and all nighters did not allow time for consideration of such details.
